    "## Part 0:  Data Loaders\n",
    "\n",
    "Write data loaders for each of the four datasets listed above.  Use the same API as in assignment 1 for creating the penguins dataset, which mimics the data loaders provided by scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a function ```load_qsar``` should return a feature matrix X and labels vector y for this dataset.  Similarly for the other datasets.  For the ```load_breast_cancer``` function, you may use the scikit-learn function that creates the dataset.  Since the gisette dataset has separate training and validation sets (that you will use as training / test sets), you will need to write two data loaders - one for the training set, and one for the test set.  Note that you will need to convert the labels from the values 0,1 to $\\pm 1$, since that is what our perceptron learning algorithm expects as label values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Missing values\n",
    "Whenever a dataset has missing values, any training example that has missing features should be removed.  (An alternative to removing training examples is to *impute* missing features, e.g. by replacing missing values by the average of that feature.)\n",

    "Store all the files you download in a sub-directory called `data` relative to the location of your notebook.  \n",

    "#### A note on the heart disease diagnosis dataset\n",
    "The heart disease diagnosis dataset has several data files associated with it.  Use [this file](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/processed.cleveland.data), where categorical variables have been replaced with numerical vaues.  The last column in the file contains the label associated with each example.  In the processed file, a label `0` corresponds to a healthy individual; other values correspond to varying levels of heart disease.  **In your experiments focus on the binary classification problem of trying to distinguish between healthy and non-healthy individuals.**\n"

In supervised learning we work with a dataset of $N$ labeled examples, each of which is a pair $(\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)$, where $\\mathbf{x}_i$ is a $d$-dimensional vector (we always use boldface to denote vectors), and $y_i$ is the label associated with $\\mathbf{x}_i$.  Keep in mind that the formulation of the perceptron algorithm that we used in class relies on the labels being $\\pm 1$, so make sure that is the case for the data you use!\n",

Do so by estimating the accuracy on a sample of the data that you reserve for testing (the test set).  In each case reserve  70% of the data for training, and 30% for testing.  To gain more confidence in your error estimates, repeat this experiment using 10 random splits of the data into training/test sets for each algorithm.  Use the same train-test splits for each algorithm.  Report the average accuracy and its standard deviation in a nicely formatted table.  Is there a classifier among the two that appears to perform better?  In answering this, consider the differences in performance you observe in comparison to the standard deviation.  Make sure to let the perceptron algorithm run for a sufficient number of epochs.  In implementing this task, you may use a for loop to iterate over the 10 random splits.\n",
